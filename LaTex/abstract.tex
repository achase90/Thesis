\begin{abstract}
A flight data acquisition system was developed to aid unmanned vehicle designers in verifying the system's design performance. The system is reconfigurable and allows the designer to choose the correct combination of complexity, risk, and cost for a given flight test, as well as allowing the designer to reconfigure the system to meet packaging requirements. System functionality was validated by collecting data during flight of an radio-controlled aircraft, and future work includes further system validation, quantifying system accuracy, sensor fusion, and stability and control derivative estimation.
