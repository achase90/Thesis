\section{Zero Offset Calibration}
\label{preflightZeroCalib}
Before installing the data acqusition system in the aircraft, wind-off zero calibration should be acquired for the pressure sensors. To do this, connect one port to the other on each of the differential pressure sensors, then acquire data for some amount of time. Take note of these values.


\section{Post Flight Zero Offset Calibration}
After the flight is complete, a second round of zero offset calibration data should be acquired. This set ensures that any drift that occurred during the flight is accounted for. Repeat the steps outlined in Section \ref{preflightZeroCalib}.


\section{Software Usage}
Let's talk about how to use that sweet GUI of yours.
