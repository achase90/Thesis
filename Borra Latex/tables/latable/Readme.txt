LaTable 0.7 – a LATEX Table Editor
==================================

Adding tables to LATEX documents is usually a matter of typing a few lines of text as long as tables are simple and small. When larger table is needed, with merged cells, various alignment styles, etc., navigation and manual editing of the code might get a bit complicated. LaTable was designed to help in such cases.
