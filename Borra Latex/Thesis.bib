abstract = {It is a joy to feel this feedback from so many of you here today. You just heard from Alan Laub, our Society's president, about my quarter of a century in Urbana, Illinois, the birthplace of Hendrik Bode. Indeed, much of what I know about systems, control and feedback I learned from my colleagues and students at the University of Illinois, the conferrer of one of Bode's honorary doctorates. Alan hinted that there may be a parallel between this lecture and the two well known "joy of' books. Well, yes, insofar as they suggest that continuous experimentation with recipes and styles leads to joys which grow with age. My own joy of feedback has been growing for thirty plus years, ever since a Bode formula led me to my first little discovery of sensitivity points. This joy is continuing to grow and I believe that after age infinity there will be even more joy of feedback.},

abstract = {Aircraft flight control design is traditionally based on linear control theory, due to the existing wealth of tools for linear design and analysis. However, in order to achieve tactical advantages, modern fighter aircraft strive towards performing maneuvers outside the region where the dynam- ics of flight are linear, and the need for nonlinear tools arises. In this paper, backstepping is proposed as a possible framework for nonlinear flight control design. Its capabil- ities of handling five major issues – stability, performance, robustness, saturation, and disturbance attenuation – are investigated.},

abstract = {Although many of today’s nonlinear control design algorithms assume the system dynamics to be affine in the control input, this often does not hold in practice. A remedy for this is to instead design a control law in terms of some other entity that satisfies the structural assumptions of the design method. In this contribution we discuss how to realize such a virtual con- trol law in terms of the actual control variable. Given a nomi- nal static invertiblemodel of themapping between the two, the true mapping is assumed to differ from the model by a con- stant bias. Two ways of how to estimate this bias on-line and use it for feedback are proposed. One of them corresponds to adaptive backstepping, the other one is an observer based ap- proach. In both cases we investigate how to guarantee closed loop stability when the estimate is used for feedback.},

abstract = {A constrained adaptive backstepping approach is used to design a flight control law for the nonlinear model of an F-16/MATV fighter aircraft. The objectives of the control law are to track command trajectories with the total velocity VT , the angle of attack $\alpha$ and the stability-axes roll rate ps. Furthermore, regulation of the sideslip angle $\beta$ is provided. On-line parameter update laws that make use of B-spline neural networks are used to approximate the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients. Using the neural networks inside the adaptive backstepping framework ensures a stable weight updating process. The parameter update laws are able to compensate for any uncertainties or changes in the aerodynamics. The control law makes use of command filters to implement any physical or operating constraints on the control variables and states. The effect of these constraints on the input and states is estimated and used by the update laws to ensure a stable parameter estimation process even when these limitations are in effect. Simulation examples are presented to evaluate the control law on the nonlinear model of an F-16 fighter aircraft with Multi-Axis Thrust Vectoring (MATV) model. Initial simulations verify that the adaptive control law performs well on the undamaged aircraft model, the B-spline networks are able to estimate the dependency of the aerodynamic data on the aircraft variables. Longitudinal maneuvers with some symmetric structural damage and actuator damage scenarios are also simulated, where the adaptive control law has to deal with large sudden changes in the dynamics of the F-16/MATV model. The results of these simulations show that the constrained adaptive backstepping control law is able to provide accurate tracking, even after these sudden failures have occurred.},

Next the principal elements of the largely mechanical primary flight control system are reviewed with particular emphasis on the influence of nonlinearities. The characteristics and problems of augmentation (damping, stability, and feel) system mechanizations are then dealt with. The particular idiosyncracies of automatic control actuation and command augmentation schemes are stressed, because they constitute the major interfaces with the primary flight control system and an often highly variable vehicle response.},

abstract = {This document provides background, theory, and examples for full envelope manual flight control system design. An overview of aircraft dynamics and flying qualities is given to provide a basic understanding of the manual flight control problem. Details of available control design and analysis methods are presented to give the reader the required theoretical background . An inner/ outer loop control structure is proposed to achieve full envelope flight control designs. Generalized controls are implemented through the use of a control selector. An inner equalization loop is used to linearize the input/output behavior of the aircraft across the flight envelope. A robust outer loop achieves the desired level of flying qualities. This approach provides a versatile framework for the application of advanced multivariable control theory to aircraft control problems. The engineer has the freedom to choose any method which achieves the design goals. The utility of this controller structure is demonstrated in its successful application to full envelope manual flight control problems for the VISTA F-16 test aircraft and a supermaneuverable F-18 fighter. The results of linear robustness and performance analysis as well as nonlinear simulations are presented for the design examples....

abstract = {This paper examines the use of adaptive backstepping for multi-axis control of a high performance aircraft. The control law is demonstrated on a 6 Degree-of- Freedom simulation with nonlinear aerodynamic and engine models, actuator models with saturation, and turbulence. Simulation results are demonstrated for large pitch-roll maneuvers, and for maneuvers with failure of the right stabilator. There are substantial differences between the control law design and simulation models, which are used to demonstrate some robustness aspects of this control law. Actuator saturation is shown to be a considerable problem for this type of controller. However, the flexibility of the backstepping design provides opportumtIes for improvement. In particular, the Lyapunov function is modified so that the growth of integrated error and the rate of change of parameter growth are both reduced when the surface commands are growing at a rate that will likely saturate the actuators. In addition, the deadzone technique from robust linear adaptive control is applied to improve robustness to turbulence.},

abstract = {In this thesis we study a number of nonlinear control problems motivated by their appearance in flight control. The results are presented in a general framework and can also be applied to other areas. The two main topics are backstepping and control allocation. Backstepping is a nonlinear control design method that provides an alternative to feedback linearization. Here, backstepping is used to derive robust linear control laws for two nonlinear systems, related to angle of attack control and flight path angle control, respectively. The resulting control laws require less modeling infor- mation than corresponding designs based on feedback linearization, and achieve global stability in cases where feedback linearization can only be performed locally. Further, a method for backstepping control of a rigid body is developed, based on a vector description of the dynamics. We also discuss how to augment an existing nonlinear controller to suppress constant input disturbances. Two methods, based on adaptive backstepping and nonlinear observer design, are proposed. Control allocation deals with actuator utilization for overactuated systems. In this thesis we pose the control allocation problem as a constrained least squares problem to account for actuator position and rate constraints. Efficient solvers based on active set methods are developed with similar complexity to existing, approximate, pseudoinverse methods. A method for dynamic control allocation is also proposed which enables a frequency dependent control distribution among the actuators to be designed. Further, the relationship between control allocation and linear quadratic control is investigated. It is shown that under certain circum- stances, the two techniques give the same freedom in distributing the control effort among the actuators. An advantage of control allocation, however, is that since the actuator constraints are considered, the control capabilities of the actuator suite can be fully exploited. },

abstract = {This article presents an approach to control of the aerodynamic angles (µ, $\alpha$, $\beta$) of an aircraft using back- stepping control techniques and on-line function ap- proximation. Backstepping allows the control signal to be constructed without separating the dynamics into slow and fast states, as has been done in the past, and also allows easy handling of unmatched uncertainties in the plant dynamics. On-line function approxima- tors are used to learn the aircraft’s aerodynamic forces and moments in-flight and provide robustness to para- metric plant uncertainties. These uncertainties can stem from various sources such as modelling errors introduced at design time, in-flight failures/damage, or even modelling mismatch caused by applying the controller to an aircraft with a different configuration than which it was designed for. The advantages of this control approach are that it deals with the complete plant dynamics directly, provides bounded tracking in the face of significant nonlinear plant uncertainty, and that the functions learned on-line are components of the aerodynamic forces and moments and thus have physical meaning. Numerical simulation results from the application of this approach to a nonlinear tailless aircraft are also presented.},

This survey describes their activation into design tools and constructive procedures. Structural properties of nonlinear systems, such as relative degree and zero dynamics, are connected to passivity, while dissipativity, as a finite L2-gain property, also appears in the disturbance attenuation problem, a nonlinear counterpart of robust linear control. Passivation-based designs exploit the connections between passivity and inverse optimality, and between Lyapunov functions and optimal value functions. Recursive design procedures, such as backstepping and forwarding, achieve certain optimal propertie s for important classes of nonlinear systems. The survey concludes with four representative applications. The selection of the topics and their interpretations are greatly in\#uenced by the experience and personal views of the senior author.},

We design a feedback controller that globally stabilizes a broad range of possible equilibria in a nonlinear compressor model. With a novel backstepping design we retain the system's useful nonlinearities which would be cancelled in a feedback linearizing design. The design control law is simple and, moreover, it is optimal with respect to a meaningful nonquadratic cost functional. As in a previous bifurcation-theoretic design, we change the character of the bifurcation at the stall inception point from subcritical to supercritical. However, since we approach the bifurcation control using Lyapunov tools, our controller achieves not only local but also global stability. The controller requires minimal modeling information and simpler sensing (rotating stall is stabilized without measuring its amplitude)},

@phdthesis{Harkegard2001a,
abstract = {Aircraft flight control design is traditionally based on linear control theory, due to the existing wealth of tools for linear design and analysis. However, in order to achieve tactical advantages, modern fighter aircraft strive towards performing maneuvers outside the region where the dynamics of flight are linear, and the need for nonlinear tools arises. In this thesis we investigate backstepping as a new framework for nonlinear flight control design. Backstepping is a recently developed design tool for constructing globally stabilizing control laws for a certain class of nonlinear dynamic systems. Flight control laws for two different control objectives are designed. First, general purpose maneuvering is considered, where the angle of attack, the sideslip angle, and the roll rate are the controlled variables. Second, automatic control of the flight path angle control is considered. The key idea of the backstepping designs is to benefit from the naturally stabilizing aerodynamic forces acting on the aircraft. The resulting state feedback control laws thereby rely on less knowledge of these forces compared to control laws based on feedback linearization, which today is the prevailing nonlinear design technique within aircraft flight control. The backstepping control laws are shown to be inverse optimal with respect to meaningful cost functionals. This gives the controllers certain gain margins which implies that stability is preserved for a certain amount of control surface saturation. Also, the problem of handling a model error appearing at the input of a nonlinear dynamic system is treated, by considering the model error as an unknown, additive disturbance. Two schemes, based on adaptive backstepping and nonlinear observer design, are proposed for estimating and adapting to such a disturbance. These are used to deal with model errors in the description of the aerodynamic moments acting on the aircraft. The designed control laws are evaluated using realistic aircraft simulation models and the results are highly encouraging.},

@article{Sonneveldt2007,
abstract = {Thedesign ofan adaptive backsteppingflight control law for theF-16/MATV(multi-axis thrust vectoring) aircraft is discussed. The control law tracks reference trajectories with the angle of attack, the stability-axes roll rate ps, and the total velocityVT. Furthermore, the sideslip anglehas to be kept at zero. B-spline neural networks are used inside the parameter update laws of the backstepping control law to approximate the uncertain aerodynamic forces and moments. Command filters are used to implement the constraints on the control surfaces and the virtual control states. The stability of the parameter estimation process during periods of saturation is guaranteed by using a modified tracking error definition, in which the effect of the saturation has been filtered out. The controller and its performance are evaluated on a nonlinear, six-degrees-of-freedom dynamic model of an F-16/MATV aircraft in a number of simulation scenarios.},
